Demo using the new (beta) MovieStim2 to play a video file. Path of video
needs to updated to point to a video you have. MovieStim2 does /not/ require
avbin to be installed.
Movie2 does require:
1. Python OpenCV package (so openCV libs and the cv2 python interface).
    * For Windows, a binary installer is available at
        http: //www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/  # opencv
    * For Linux, it is available via whatever package manager you use.
    * For OSX, ..... ?
2. VLC application. The architeceture of this needs to match your psychopy/python installation 64/32 bit
    whether or not your *operating system* is 64/32 bit
